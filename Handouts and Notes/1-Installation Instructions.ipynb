    "# 1. Downloading and Running the Miniconda Installer for Python 3.7\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniconda is a lite version of Anaconda that uses less disk space. (This step is not needed if you have Anaconda 3 installed already.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the installer** for your Operating System (OS) here: https://conda.io/miniconda.html. Make sure you select Python 3.7.\n",
    "2. **Run the installer** and keep the default options. (Choose the default location for copying files and to add this location to your \"PATH\" environment variable.)\n",
    "\n",
    " - For windows, simply double click the .exe file downloaded, and choose the two options above.\n",
    " - For Mac or Linux, you would open a Terminal and type in the following, replacing the capitalized terms with the correct location. Then, go through the user agreement and type yes for everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd PATH_WHERE_YOU_DOWNLOADED_THE_FILE_STARTING_WITH_SLASH\n",
    "bash NAME_OF_FILE_YOU_DOWNLOADED\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, depending on where you downloaded the installer, this might be\n",
    "``` \n",
    "cd /home/user/pengshi/Downloads/\n",
    "bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a lot of disk space, an alternative to the above steps would be to install the full Anaconda distribution,  following the instructions here: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid potentially difficult IT challenges later, it is highly recommended that you use Anaconda/Miniconda for this class, instead of alternative ways of installing Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Installing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "A package is a set of files or resources that are packed together to provide a related set of functionalities. To install the necessary Python packages for this class, launch the **Anaconda Prompt** if you are using Windows, or open a new terminal if you are using Mac or linux, and type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas jupyter ipython spyder seaborn xlrd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then type \"y\" for yes to install. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter an error message, check that you typed the above exactly (or copy and paste the above command into the terminal). If you still get the error message, then copy and paste the error message into Google to find the solution. (One important skill this class encourages you to build is to be able to debug IT issues on your own, because you are bound to face similar challenges in the work place as technology often has hiccups.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Launching Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if installation was successful, type the following command (into the Anaconda Prompt if you are using Windows, or into a terminal if you are using Mac or Linux) to launch Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should start a web browser with a directory structure, where the base directory is the one where you typed the above command. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is a web-based interface built on top of Python that makes performing analysis using Python and sharing the result easy. We will be using this tool extensively in this class, so it is a good idea to familarize yourself by following this short tutorial: https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Assignment 0 (Due on Blackboard before Session 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment checks that you were able to successfullying install Python and the packages needed for the class, and are able to run a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the \"Assignment 0.ipynb\" file from Blackboard, under Homework 0 in the Assignments tab. Save this file to an accessible location, preferably in a sub-directory of where you launched jupyter notebook earlier. \n",
    "2. Open Anaconda Prompt (if using Windows) or a termnial (if using Mac/Linux), and navigate to a folder that is a parent directory of where you saved the file in step 1.\n",
    "3. Type `jupyter notebook` to open Jupyter notebook, and navigate to the \"assignment0.ipynb\" file, and double click to open it.\n",
    "4. Click the cell containing \"Name: XXX\" to edit and replace the XXX with your name.\n",
    "5. Run the entire script by clicking Kernel -> Restart and Run All. \n",
    "6. Verify that the last line of the output is \"Success (Python 3.7).\" If you see a garble of text containing the word 'Error,\" then something went wrong with your installation. You should Google the error message to figure out what was wrong and fix it. \n",
    "7. After verifying that the last line of the output is \"Success (Python 3.7),\" save the notebook by clicking File -> Save and Checkpoint.\n",
    "8. Upload the modified \"Assignment 0.ipynb\" unto Blackboard by the deadline.\n"
